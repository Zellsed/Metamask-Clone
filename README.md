# MetaMass Clone Wallet

Building Metamask: A DeFi Wallet Clone Inspired by MetaMask
As a personal project, I built and deployed MetaMass â€“ a decentralized wallet inspired by MetaMask. This project helped me dive deeper into Web3 technologies, focusing on secure key management, dApp integration, and seamless user experience.

MetaMass allows users to safely manage digital assets, connect to DeFi protocols, and interact with the Ethereum blockchain. By replicating key MetaMask features, I aimed to create a familiar yet secure environment for both new and experienced users.

This project strengthened my skills in blockchain development, React, Web3.js, and crypto wallet architecture.
